Think About It
We need an operating system since it has the full power of machine controlling.

But why should we need “ROM” and “boot loader”?

One Line Answer
It's all about the preparation.

Let's take a look at what they do before the operating system starting up.

ROM
Think this step as a basic hardware initialization.

Which components have been intialized?

The core mudules, such as:

CPU (at least one)
RAM (maybe only built-in)
I/Os (optional)
Satisfy Von Neumann architecture so that we can execute the instructinos (of the boot loader).

Boot Loader
What things have been done with the “boot loader”?

CPU
RAM
I/Os (optional)
File system (optional)
We are now able to launch operating system.

Operating System
“Operating systems are designed as if they never start or stop, ...”
So we temporarily omit it here.

It's so-called chain loading
The general introduction ends up.

Let's check out what OMAP4-design does.
